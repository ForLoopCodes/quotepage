# Project Readme - Dynamic Quote Generator with Svelte

## Overview

This project is a dynamic quote generator web page built using Svelte, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches random quotes from the [Quotable](https://api.quotable.io/) API, featuring a visually appealing background with a dynamically changing color, an animated noise effect, and custom font styling. Svelte is employed for a reactive and efficient front-end development experience.

2. **Colorful Background:**
   - The background color of the page changes dynamically on each visit, creating a visually appealing atmosphere.

3. **Noise Effect:**
   - An SVG element with a fractal noise filter produces a noise effect, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the page.

4. **Svelte Framework:**
   - Svelte is used for building reactive components and managing the dynamic behavior of the web page.
